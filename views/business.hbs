              <p>The issues presented in a dissolution of marriage action as a consequence of a family business are many.  Some are as follows: </p>

                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>Family businesses take a variety of forms such as a sole proprietorship, corporation, LLC or partnership owned just by the parties or with other owners, or a professional business such as a medical, dental, law, psychological practice.  The business may have been started by a party prior to marriage or purchased with funds that can be traced directly to the separate property of a spouse, in which case at least a part of the value may be separate property.  The business may have been started during marriage with community funds in which case the business is probably a community asset.  Ultimately the business is important for two reasons, namely, what is it worth for division of property purposes and the income generated for child and/or spousal support.</p>

              <h2>VALUING THE BUSINESS:</h2>
              <p>Generally all assets including businesses are valued as of the time of trial.  For good cause the court can order that the business or any other asset valued as of a different date if fairness would require it.  Usually it is necessary to employ a forensic accountant to assist in valuation and determination of income. Value can be determined by a fair market value approach or an investment value approach.  Buy-sell agreements can be considered although they are not the last word on the issue of value in a divorce.  The ultimate value of the community property share of the business may play a large part in how the business will be ultimately divided in the divorce and whether the business will be kept by one or both parties or whether it will be sold.  If one of the parties wants to keep the business, that party may have to pay the other spouse for the community value of the business or the other party may be awarded other assets to equalize the value of the community business.  Whether the other spouse may compete with the party keeping the business is another issue that must be considered.</p>
              
              <p>The fair market value of a business is the price between a willing buyer and seller. It may be the subject of the opinion of a broker, appraiser or accountant.  This approach is generally used for businesses that are typically bought/sold, like a restaurant, market or other manufacturing business.</p>

              <p>A business can have value for divorce purposes even though it may not be able to be sold on the open market.The business can have value even if the business would not be able to continue without one of the parties running it.  An example of this is a law practice or other professional practice.  In such a case the approach to determine value may be the investment value of a business which is the value to a specific owner or a prospective owner.  The business would be valued as a going concern even if the operating party threatens to walk away from the business. This approach is often determined by opinion of an accountant based on an analysis of the books of the business and the owners knowledge, ability and earnings potential, as well as other factors.  There are many factors to be taken into consideration which analysis gives rise to variance between appraisers/accountants on issues such as:</p>

                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2>PROTECTING THE BUSINESS DURING THE DIVORCE PROCESS:</h2>
              <p>The path that you must travel to determine valuation, division of the business and income available for support must begin early.  Orders may be necessary to protect the business from being wasted or mismanaged during the process.  Some businesses are more prone to mismanagement than others.  The solely owned cash generating construction, plumbing or restaurant business may be more subject to manipulation than the corporation owned by other third parties that uses an accountant to keep their books and records.</p>

              <p>Temporary orders may be necessary to protect the business including restraining orders, orders regarding disclosure of business affairs, or even appointment of a receiver to manage or oversee the business operation.</p>
